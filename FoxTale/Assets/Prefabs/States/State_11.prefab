  text: "You make it to the door opening of the abandoned cabin with Nibbles right
    behind you. You can see that the dust lays heavy on the furniture and the cabin
    has an earthy smell to it.  You move one paw at a time slowly making it further
    into the cabin. \r\n\u201CHey, are you sure you want to go there?\u201D you heard
    Nibbles say where he stands in the opening.\r\n \u201CI\u2019m too curious not
    to. Maybe we can find something we could find useful\u201D you answered back.
    \r\nYou accidentally place one of your front paws on an unstable floorboard making
    it crack and you suddenly fall through the floor. You end up landing on the hard
    dirt underneath the cabin and the dust from the fall makes you cough.  \r\nYou
    can hear Nibbles shouting above you \u201CAre you okay my friend?\u201D \r\nHow
    I\u2019m able to come up here you think to yourself. \r\n\u201CWe need to find
    a way to get me up from here\u201D you shout back to Nibbles. \r\nTO BE CONTINUED\u2026\r\n"
