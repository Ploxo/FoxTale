    The squirrel moves along with you and thanks you for helping him. He also says
    his name is \u201CNibbles'' and asks where you are going. You tell the squirrel
    you are going to the new world where the grass is green and everything flourishes.
    Nibbles light up \u201COh please take me with you on the journey there!\u201D
    You agree that he could follow you, it would be nice to have some company along
    your journey.  \r\n\r\nYou continue walking further into the forest at the other
    side of the stream and walk about 500m while Nibbles talks about how hungry he
    is before\u2026\r\n"
