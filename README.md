## About

This mobile game was developed during the game development course (Game Development DIT460 during master's). The mobile game was developed in collaboration with 'Generation Pep' (an organization that focuses on making children physically exercise more). The game targets kids aged 11 and up, the game incorporates visual novel elements and physical movement, tasks that have to be completed through physical movement which can vary from walking a short distance to jumping, etc.

## My contribution

I made the typewriter effect for the text and implemented Text-to-Speech (TTS) into the game, I also made sure the TTS was configurable for example being able to change voice and change how fast the TTS reads.
